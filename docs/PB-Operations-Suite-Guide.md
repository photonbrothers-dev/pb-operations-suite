## Troubleshooting Common Questions

**Q: A project shows "Unknown" location - what do I do?**
A: Update the `pb_location` field in HubSpot. The dashboards pull this field to categorize projects.

**Q: Why is a project's priority score so high?**
A: Check: Is it overdue? Is it PE? Is it high value? All three factors increase score.

**Q: A PE project missed a milestone - now what?**
A: Contact PE program manager immediately. Some grace periods exist. Document the delay reason in HubSpot.

**Q: How often should I refresh the data?**
A: The Excel files are point-in-time snapshots. HTML dashboards should be regenerated weekly or when significant changes occur.

**Q: Can I edit the Excel files?**
A: Yes, but changes won't sync back to HubSpot. Use Excel for analysis and notes, but make official updates in HubSpot.
